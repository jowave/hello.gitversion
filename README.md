# Hello GitVersion

Examples on how to get semantic versioning automated using [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion) not only with .NET but also with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) & [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/)

## How to use

Clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/mkoertgen/hello.gitversion.git

Then start playing around with [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/), e.g. using [Atlassian SourceTree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview).

For instance, Create a `feature`, do a `release` or a `hotfix` and check

    gitversion

how versioning is affected.
